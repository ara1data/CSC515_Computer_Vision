Many computer vision applications use geometric transformations to change the position, orientation, and size of objects present in a scene. One such application where geometric transformations should be applied is counterfeit banknote detection. 

Take a look at this image: Banknotes (shutterstock227361781--125.jpg)

1. Import this image into OpenCV and examine its pixels matrix.  
2. Discuss the translations you would perform to identify whether the banknotes are counterfeit and why you would apply them for counterfeit detection.
3. Describe how you would manually apply the transformations to this imageâ€™s pixels matrix?
4. Discuss in detail your transformation matrices.  
5. Apply your transformations and attach your transformed image to your post.
