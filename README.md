# CSC515_Computer_Vision

This repository contains notes, programs, and deliverables completed by Alex Reichart-Anderson during the graduate course: CSC517 Introduction to Conputer Vision.

## Course Description:
In this Graduate course, students will apply digital image construction and processing. Students will explore topics associated with image formation, image acquisition, and image geometry. Students will be exposed to the techniques required to efficiently analyze images for representation in applicable context scenarios. Students will also apply image processing techniques for filtering and edge detection for image deconstruction.

## Course Learning Outcomes:
1. Using an image processing model, create an algorithm to solve a specific computer vision problem.
2. Describe and recognize 2D and SD Shapes, understand transformations.
3. Manage image sizes, convert color images to grayscale images, augment and transform images.
4. Implement an application using appropriate image filters.
5. Compare various image segmentation techniques and understand morphology.
6. Select an appropriate edge detection method to identify edges and corners in an image.
