Fingerprints are tiny patterns on the tip of every finger. The uniqueness of fingerprints has been studied and it is well established that the probability of two fingerprints matching is extremely small. Since they are unique, fingerprints can be used to identify or confirm the identity of an individual.

Fingerprint recognition refers to the automated method of identifying or confirming the identity of an individual based on the comparison of two fingerprints. These comparisons can be made based on the type and the position of the ridge characteristics. The performance of fingerprint recognition applications heavily rely on the input fingerprint image quality.

A latent fingerprint is left on a surface by deposits of oils and/or perspiration from the finger. It is not usually visible but may be detected with special techniques such as dusting for fingerprints. In order to reduce rejection rates in most cases the acquired latent fingerprints have to be enhanced prior to matching to reduce the degradation, noise, or incompleteness. Enhancement can be achieved using morphological image processing.

Acquire an image of a latent fingerprint. In OpenCV, write algorithms to process the image using morphological operations (dilation, erosion, opening, and closing).

Next, write a 2-3 page summary of your observed results. Include in your summary, the following:
1. Describe in detail what enhancements did each morphological operation make on the image and how beneficial these enhancements are for fingerprint recognition.
2. Did the enhancement also result in data loss of other features? Explain.
3. Research morphological operations for fingerprint enhancements and include whether your results were similar with the findings in these. Be sure to cite them in your summary using correct APA styling.
