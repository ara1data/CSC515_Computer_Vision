## Option #1: Drawing Functions in OpenCV

In face and object detection, it is often useful to draw on the image. Perhaps you would like to put bounding boxes around features or use text to tag objects/people in the image. 

Use a camera to take a picture of yourself facing the frontal.  In OpenCV, draw on the image a red bounding box for your eyes and a green circle around your face.  Then tag the image with the text “this is me”.

Your submission should be one executable Python file.
